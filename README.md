# Celebrating Ghanaian Heritage: Wiki Loves Living Heritage, Wikisource, and Field Trips

The **Ghanaian Wikimedia Languages Meetup 2024** was a vibrant gathering that highlighted the importance of preserving cultural and linguistic heritage through digital platforms. One of the standout sessions was led by **Joris Darlington**, who delved into two crucial Wikimedia initiatives: **Wiki Loves Living Heritage** and **Wikisource**. These projects are instrumental in documenting and celebrating intangible cultural heritage, particularly in regions like Ghana, where many indigenous languages are at risk.

During his presentation, **Joris Darlington** explored the impact and goals of Wiki Loves Living Heritage and Wikisource. He emphasized the urgent need to preserve Ghana’s approximately 81 native languages, many of which are endangered due to the dominance of Akan and English in education and media. Languages such as Ga-Dangme, Ewutu-Efutu, Nzema, and Adamorobe Sign Language face severe threats, making preservation efforts critical for maintaining cultural identity and promoting linguistic diversity.

[**Wiki Loves Living Heritage**](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:MyLanguage/Wiki_Loves_Living_Heritage) is a global campaign that documents and celebrates intangible cultural heritage. It engages communities, Wikimedia volunteers, and heritage practitioners to share traditions like oral histories and rituals. This initiative promotes the awareness and preservation of cultural practices through ethical sharing and open access, ensuring that valuable cultural traditions are not lost to time.

[**Wikisource**](https://wikisource.org) serves as a valuable resource for historical preservation by providing free access to public domain texts and historical documents. It supports texts in multiple languages, fostering global collaboration and educational use. By digitizing and making historical texts available, Wikisource contributes to the preservation of cultural heritage and provides a crucial educational resource.

In connection with the **Wiki Loves Living Heritage** and **Wikisource** session, participants embarked on field trips to the **Red Clay Studio** and the **Savannah Centre for Contemporary Art (SCCA)** in Tamale. These visits were integral to the session’s theme, providing hands-on experience in documenting and preserving local heritage.

**Red Clay Studio** is a creative space that showcases contemporary art and cultural artefacts. Participants had the opportunity to document the studio’s unique collection, capturing the essence of Ghanaian artistic expression. This documentation aligns with the goals of Wiki Loves Living Heritage, ensuring that these cultural treasures are preserved and accessible to a global audience.

**Savannah Centre for Contemporary Art (SCCA)** is a hub for contemporary art and cultural dialogue. The visit to SCCA allowed participants to engage with modern interpretations of Ghanaian heritage, further emphasizing the importance of preserving both traditional and contemporary cultural practices. By documenting the exhibits and activities at SCCA, participants contributed to the broader goal of celebrating and preserving Ghanaian cultural heritage.
